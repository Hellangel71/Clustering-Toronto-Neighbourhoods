# Clustering-Toronto-Neighbourhoods 

The city of Toronto is made up of various neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods host numerous venues distributed in and around them.

Using foursquare API and Folium library, the location and venue data of each neighbourhood is obtained.
Using Machine Learning Clustering - K-Means Clustering the venues are clustered together.
The top 5 venues within each neighbourhood are selected on the basis of clusters formed.
Observations are noted and necessary conclusions are reached.
