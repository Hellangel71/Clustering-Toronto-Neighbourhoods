# Clustering-Toronto-Neighbourhoods
This repository includes clustering of toronto neighbourhoods into various clusters based on the venues in each neighbourhoods.
I have used foursquare API to get the location and venue data of each neighbourhoods and clustered them using K-Means.
The top 5 venues within each neighbourhood are selected and clusters are formed.
Observations are found and conclusions are reached.
